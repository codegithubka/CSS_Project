General guidelines:
a. Fixed color scheme: prey: #1751ED, predator: #CF0808
b. Legend at the bottom and shared if more than one plot


1. Bifuractuion (Mean population vs. prey death rate)
- zoomed out (phase 1)
- zoomed in (phase 1.5)

2. Critical Point Power Law
- At the critical point and away from the critical point (pick critical, subcritical, supercritical)

3. Finite size scaling
- Cluster distributions vs. system size

4. Sensitivity Analysis
- Undirected
- Directed
    - 3-dimensional plot with hydra effect salient feature which is the weight of the quadratic term of the second order polynomial fitted to
        the inbcreasing part of the function before the collapse
        - X: Prey birth
        - Y: Predator birth
        - Z: Predator death
        - W: Prey death

        - Do manual plot selection. 3 sets of 11 plots; each set where the 11 different plots to vary eveything except prey death
        - See which one is the most consistent -> lose that dimension to have a 3D plot left.

    - 3-dimensional heatmap instead (preferrable)

5. Evolution
- Log-log plot for cluster size distrubution at the convergence point
- Convergence pointsa across intiial conditions to show independence. (But why?) -> probably no convergence.
